  title: About me
  summary: |
          I'm a front-end developer with 5 years of development
          experience, and 8 years of experience in hands-on technology roles.
          I love the challenge of learning new coding languages, while staying
          up-to-date with the ones I'm comfortable with. I'm passionate
          about design and user experience. My hobbies include video games,
          reading, traveling, puns, tea, sweet snacks, and enjoying well-crafted beer.

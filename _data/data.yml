  title: About me
  summary: |
          I'm a front-end engineer with 10+ years of experience in hands-on
          technology roles and development experience.
          I enjoy the challenge of learning new coding languages and experimenting with AI,
          while staying up-to-date with the ones I'm comfortable with. I'm passionate
          about accessibility, design and user experience. My hobbies include video games,
          reading, traveling, puns, tea, sweet snacks, and playing rhythm games in arcades.
